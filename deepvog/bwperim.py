def bwperim(bw, n=4):
    """
    perim = bwperim(bw, n=4)
    Find the perimeter of objects in binary images.
    A pixel is part of an object perimeter if its value is one and there
    is at least one zero-valued pixel in its neighborhood.
    By default the neighborhood of a pixel is 4 nearest pixels, but
    if `n` is set to 8 the 8 nearest pixels will be considered.
    Parameters
    ----------
      bw : A black-and-white image
      n : Connectivity. Must be 4 or 8 (default: 8)
    Returns
    -------
      perim : A boolean image
